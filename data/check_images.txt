Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No not all models classified the bread of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be germen shepherd dog. AlexNet misclassified Dog_01.jpg as rottweiler. But VGG and ResNet identified the dog breed correctly. Here is the result in detail.
        - AlexNet: rottweiler
        - ResNet: german shepherd, german shepherd dog, german police dog, alsatian
        - VGG: german shepherd, german shepherd dog, german police dog, alsatian


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No sadly AlexNet and ResNet identified the two dog as different dog breeds. But VGG identified both images as same dog breed. Here is more detail result.
        - AlexNet:
            * Dog_01.jpg: rottweiler
            * Dog_02.jpg: brabancon griffon
        - ResNet:
            * Dog_01.jpg: german shepherd, german shepherd dog, german police dog, alsatian
            * Dog_02.jpg: rottweiler
        - VGG:
            * Dog_01.jpg: german shepherd, german shepherd dog, german police dog, alsatian
            * Dog_02.jpg: german shepherd, german shepherd dog, german police dog, alsatian


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: All the three models (architectures) correctly classified those non dog image as not dog.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Of all I liked VGG the most. So far it is the most accurate one of all three. To mention some, it correctly identified the two dog picture as same breed which makes it more reliable and winner.
